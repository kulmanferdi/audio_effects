# Audio effects

Audio effects in **MATLAB**:

- **Reverb**: Simulates the natural reflections of sound in an environment, adding depth, spaciousness, and a sense of realism to the audio.
- **Chorus**: Creates a rich and shimmering sound by blending delayed and pitch-modulated copies of the original signal, often mimicking multiple sources.
- **Delay (Echo)**: Repeats the input signal with a specified time delay and decay factor, producing distinct echoes or rhythmic patterns.
- **Distortion**: Amplifies and clips the signal to introduce harmonic saturation or aggressive tones, commonly used in rock and electronic music.
- **Tremolo**: Modulates the amplitude of the signal at a low frequency, creating a pulsating or wavy volume effect.
